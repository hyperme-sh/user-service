# Releasing user-service

Releases for this service are container images, tagged with channel or version tags only. There is no Python package, wheel, or prepared-snapshot distribution.

- TEST uses the `:test` channel tag.
- Production uses a version tag, and the `:prod` channel tag as the moving alias. Production release tags in Azure Container Registry stay write-protected, as described in [FyberLabs/infra#959](https://github.com/FyberLabs/infra/issues/959).

Public container publication and the remaining Apache repositories are tracked in [FyberLabs/infra#993](https://github.com/FyberLabs/infra/issues/993).

Pull-request and `main` checks still build and test the source, including any clean-source or secret scan already in those jobs, and then discard temporary distribution files. They do not retain or publish package artifacts.

Tag-time version admission, when used, stays in `.github/workflows/release-admission.yml`. That workflow does not publish. The former package release-channel workflow has been removed.
